# sql-challenge

## Background
It’s been two weeks since you were hired as a new data engineer at Pewlett Hackard (a fictional company). Your first major task is to do a research project about people whom the company employed during the 1980s and 1990s. All that remains of the employee database from that period are six CSV files.

For this project, you’ll design the tables to hold the data from the CSV files, import the CSV files into a SQL database, and then answer questions about the data. That is, you’ll perform data modeling, data engineering, and data analysis, respectively.


## Steps
* Step 1: Find the columns in each of the 6 .CSV files that could be used to connect all of the tables. 
* Step 2: Create a schematic diagram using QuickDBD which shows what data is in each table and how that data connects the tables. 
* Step 3: Create tables in Postgres using schema from QuickDBD. 
* Step 4: Import each of the .csv files to the corresponding table. 
* Step 5: Write SQL queries to asnwer each question.
